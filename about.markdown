Ensemble is the student-run Undergraduate Physics Club of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. We are a group of inquisitive individuals - driven towards grasping a tiny sliver of all there is - and welcome anyone with a slight tinge of mania for knowledge.

With a motive to let newcomers in on the secrets of how the world works, we organise lecture series where talks are given by our in-house senior club members. Other than lectures, we've held a myriad events - lab visits, talks by professors and PhD. students, movie screenings, problem solving sessions, with more yet to come!

The annual landmark event for the club is Open Day, an occasion organised by the institute. On this day, the gates are opened for the general public to immerse themselves in the enchantments and experiments on display. Ensemble has its own exhibits and volunteers who work arduously to prepare posters and present to all the curious countenances who approach them.

Get in touch with Ensemble by using the email-id given below, or the email addresses of the current convenors.
