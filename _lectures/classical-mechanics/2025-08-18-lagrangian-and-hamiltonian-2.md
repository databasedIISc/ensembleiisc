In this session, we will continue from where we left off with the Lagrangian formalism and explore its properties, followed by a parallel discussion of the Hamiltonian formalism. We will then move on to canonical transformations and Poisson brackets. If time permits, we will also touch upon other canonical invariants, Noether’s theorem, and work through a few illustrative examples.
