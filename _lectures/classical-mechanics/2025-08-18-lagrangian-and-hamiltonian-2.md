<!--more-->
In this session, we will continue from where we left off with the Lagrangian formalism and explore its properties, followed by a parallel discussion of the Hamiltonian formalism. We will then move on to canonical transformations and Poisson brackets. If time permits, we will also touch upon other canonical invariants, Noetherâ€™s theorem, and work through a few illustrative examples.
