Talk

<!--more-->

We are delighted to invite you to a talk by Nandagopal Manoj (PhD, Caltech) on an exciting topic at the interface of quantum information and many-body physics.
The talk is about entanglement transitions in random unitary circuits with mid-circuit measurements, mostly as an excuse to introduce you to thinking about quantum dynamics using tensor networks. It will be based on Brian Skinner’s 2023 lecture notes (arXiv:2307.02986)
 
Event Details
Speaker : **Nandogopal Manoj (PhD student at Caltech)**
Date: **17th September (Wednesday)**
Time: **6:30 PM**
Venue: **F-08A, OPB**
 
##About the Speaker 
Nandagopal Manoj is currently pursuing his PhD in Physics at Caltech, working broadly in the areas of quantum many-body physics and quantum information. He completed his undergraduate studies at IISc, and it is a pleasure to have him return to share his work with the IISc community.
 
##Prerequisites 
Necessary: Elementary Quantum mechanics: bra–ket notation, unitary operators, Born rule for quantum measurement, and how to write Hilbert spaces and operators for two (or more) spin-1/2 degrees of freedom using individual Hilbert spaces and Pauli operators.
Helpful if familiar with: Surface-level knowledge of Von Neumann entanglement entropy, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Schmidt decomposition, scale invariance in (classical) phase transitions, and percolation transitions.
We hope to see you all there! After the talk, the speaker will also be glad to chat informally about research directions, project ideas, and graduate school applications.
