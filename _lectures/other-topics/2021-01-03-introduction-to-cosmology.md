Title of the Talk: Introduction to Cosmology :- The Friedmann equation, Benchmark Model and Inflation

## Abstract

One of the fundamental equations that allows us to systematically study different models of the universe is the Friedmann equation and as such, it is perhaps one of the most important equations in the field of cosmic dynamics. We will take a brief look at what this equation entails â€“ and how different solutions of this abstract equation can describe the observable universe and also give us a glimpse into the past, present and future of the cosmos on its grandest scales. We will also discuss what is currently the most widely accepted model of the universe and also discuss a time in the very early history of the universe, which (cosmologists argue) has had a major influence on its history, in a manner accessible to everybody, including first and second-year UGs, who are highly encouraged to attend.

## Pre-requisite

Almost none. Basic high-school Newtonian mechanics, coordinate geometry and differential equations (the very rudimentary ones). Whenever math is used during the talk, it will be supplemented by physics!
