Speaker: Hitesh Kishore, a 5th Year BSc-MSc integrated student
Topic: 'Physics of Astrophysical mediums'

## Abstract

The "empty" space between astrophysical objects is filled with a gaseous medium which constitutes a substantial portion of observable matter. One has the interstellar medium within the galaxy, circumgalactic medium around the galaxies and the intracluster or intergalactic medium between the galaxies. These mediums are a significant part of the universe's evolution. In the talk, this fascinating and extremely intriguing corner of Astrophysics will be touched upon and talked about, with gusto. The talk will start from an introductory level, and it will be ensured that it is kept accessible and interesting for all undergraduates.
