We are pleased to announce a seminar by Prof. B Ananthanarayan on the recent developments surrounding the muon’s anomalous magnetic moment. The talk will provide an accessible overview of the Fermilab measurement and the present status of its theoretical prediction. No prior background is required to attend. The session will also include a brief account of related research being carried out at CHEP.
A complementary presentation by Leonard Schwarze will cover additional technical aspects of the presentation.
 
Date: Tuesday, 2nd September
Time: 06:00 PM
Venue: MLH, UG Building
 
We look forward to your participation in this seminar.
