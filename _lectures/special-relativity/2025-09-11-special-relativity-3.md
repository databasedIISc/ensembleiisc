<!--more-->
The third lecture on SR will build on the four-vectors and their transformations introduced in the last class, and further extend the discussion to tensors. We will use Minkowski diagrams to intuitively interpret relativistic phenomena. The session will then cover the Lagrangian formulation of Special Relativity. Finally, building on the idea of four-momentum, we will introduce the energy-momentum tensor and explore its applications to relativistic hydrodynamics.
