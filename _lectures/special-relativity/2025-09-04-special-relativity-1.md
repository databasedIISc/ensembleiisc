<!--more-->
Special Relativity is one of the most beautiful and revolutionary ideas in physics. It reshapes our understanding of space and time while laying the foundation for both modern technology and the deepest questions in fundamental physics. This session would be great for both freshers and sophomores to build a clear understanding of the theory.
 
The first lecture will introduce the fundamental ideas of the theory, beginning with Einstein’s postulates that revolutionized our understanding of space and time. We will begin by examining the experimental foundations that motivated the theory, then turn to Einstein’s postulates in detail. From these, we will derive the Lorentz transformations, discuss their key implications such as time dilation, length contraction, etc., and explore some famous examples.
