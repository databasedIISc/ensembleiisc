<!--more-->
The second lecture on Special Relativity will build on the Lorentz transformations and postulates introduced in the first session. We will study how velocities, accelerations, and other dynamical quantities transform under Lorentz symmetry. The lecture will also cover Minkowski diagrams, explore paradoxes in relativity, and conclude with the derivation of the famous result E = mc².

Speaker: **Gunda Sai Vinday (3rd Year UG)**  
Date: **7th September (Sunday)**
