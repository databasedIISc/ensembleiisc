<!--more-->
In this lecture, we will continue our exploration of differential geometry by formally introducing smooth manifolds and developing the structures built upon them. We will construct the notion of the tangent space at a point on a manifold, and discuss tangent vectors, covectors, and tensors as elements of these spaces. The discussion will then extend to pushforward and pullback operations, which allow us to relate these objects across different manifolds. Finally, we will conclude with the idea of vector fields and tensor fields.
