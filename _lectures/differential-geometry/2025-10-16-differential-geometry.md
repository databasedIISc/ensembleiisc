<!--more-->
We are delighted to announce a series of lectures on Differential Geometry which forms a backbone for the General Theory of Relativity.
 
General Relativity is one of the most elegant and profound theories in physics, describing the very fabric of spacetime and gravity. To truly appreciate its beauty, a solid grasp of the underlying mathematical framework: differential geometry is essential.

The first lecture will cover the basics of topology , introducing its formalism and key properties, followed by an introduction to topological and smooth manifolds, including charts, atlases, and coordinate maps. We will then go on to develop the language of tensors, which provides the mathematical structure central to GR.
