Conclusion of the exploration of classical statistical mechanics

<!--more-->

## Synopsis

This session will conclude our exploration of classical statistical mechanics formalism with the Grand canonical ensemble. We'll then shift our focus to a field-based perspective, describing applications phenomenologically. This will lay the foundation for understanding critical phenomena and introduce the concepts of statistical field theory.

**PS**
The talk was postponed to 11th March, 2025 from 9:30 PM to 11:30 PM in F-08A.
