<!--more-->
In the second lecture of Group Theory, we will begin with a recap of the basic definitions in representation theory. Then, we'll move on to a discussion of various important results for representations of finite groups, notably Schur's lemma. Then, we'll discuss character tables and their use in various physical problems. Finally, we'll introduce Lie groups and begin a discussion of their various properties. If time permits, we'll derive the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff lemma.
