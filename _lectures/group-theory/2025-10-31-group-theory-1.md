<!--more-->
We are excited to announce a session on Group Theory, a subject that forms the mathematical backbone of many areas in physics. In this lecture, we will talk about the group theory concepts essential for physics, ideas that form the mathematical foundation of symmetry, conservation laws, and particle physics.
 
We will begin with basic definitions in abstract algebra such as groups, rings, and modules, and explore some of the fundamental properties that arise from these structures. Then, we will motivate the use of group theory in physics through several well-known examples and applications. Finally, we will discuss the representation theory of finite groups and its relevance in physical systems. If time permits, we will also introduce Lie groups and their connection to manifolds.

## Details of the session:  
Speaker: **Sriraj Chandra (3rd Year UG)**  
Date: **31st October (Friday)**  
Time: **6:30 PM**  
Venue: **F-08A, OPB**
