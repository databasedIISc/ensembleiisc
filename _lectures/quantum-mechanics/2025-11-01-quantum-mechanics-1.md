We are pleased to announce a lecture series on Quantum Mechanics, one of the most profound and beautiful theory in physics, with applications across almost all branches of modern science. This series aims to provide the audience with sufficient training to use this powerful framework with appreciable comfort.

In this first lecture, we will try to start our venture into Quantum Mechanics by formally understanding the postulates of QM. We'll digress a little to talk about Hilbert Spaces, with a very light discussion on a few types of Hilbert spaces that is of interest to QM. This discussion will largely bypass the rich mathematical rigour of the formal definitions of the theory but would provide a starting point for the interested learner. We'll try to develop a recipe to tackle any dynamical problem of QM. We will also discuss the different "pictures" of QM. If time permits, we will try to study the dynamics explicitly for a few potentials and/or give an intro to the density matrix formalism. The Dirac notation, which was introduced in the Linear Algebra talk series by Ensemble, will be used freely. This lecture is majorly aimed towards the first and second year UGs.
