<!--more-->
Following our experiments with the Gaussian Wave Packet in the last class, we'll draw a few more inferences from it which will push us into a discussion on Ehrenfest Theorem and its validity. We'll also discuss why we get a deviation from Ehrenfest Theorem in the simulation we played with in the last lecture. After this, we will start with the treatment of the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, one of the most widely used potentials. Depending on the time and interest, we can either digress to talk about the Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator (You might see one application of the Poschl-Teller Potential that we discussed in last class) or skip this to start the Spin Algebra.
