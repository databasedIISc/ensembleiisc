<!--more-->
In the second lecture of Quantum Mechanics, we will pick up from where we left in the last lecture. We will discuss an example that will use concepts we have developed so far. Then we venture into the last postulate describing the evolution of a quantum state in time. We'll discuss the different pictures of QM. And then we take up a few potentials and solve the dynamics of the system explicitly for them. If time permits, I'll try to show a simulation of one of the cases we discussed. We will either stop here or set up the stage for a proper analysis of the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator.
