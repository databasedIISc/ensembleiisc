<!--more-->
In this session, we continue from where we left off last time, developing further the ideas introduced in the previous lecture. The discussion will cover the dual space, adjoint of operators, and different classes of operators. We then move to eigenvalues and diagonalization, analyzing physically important systems and an essential theorem. The talk will conclude with an introduction to infinite-dimensional vector spaces.
