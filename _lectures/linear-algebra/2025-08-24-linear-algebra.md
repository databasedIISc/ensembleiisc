<!--more-->
The session will begin by introducing vector spaces, basis, dimension, linear operators, and inner products. We will then move to Dirac's bra-ket notation and dual spaces, followed by exploring how operators can be expressed as matrices. The discussion will cover Unitary, Hermitian, Normal matrices and their properties, along with an important theorem on their diagonalization. Finally, we will conclude with a brief introduction to infinite-dimensional vector spaces which are central to quantum theory.
