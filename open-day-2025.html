    <p>Spring has set in, college midsemester exams are over, and National Science Day just passed by. The Indian Institute of Science has opened its doors for science enthusiasts, amateurs and skeptics, children and adults alike. Welcome to the haven of curiousity and wonder!
<br>
IISc hosted its Open Day on 1st March, 2025 AD, allowing the public to roam through the campus, exploring experiments, concepts, quizzes, games and competitions. The exhibitions are set up by students and faculty members, who interact with and explain to the inquisitive minds eager to listen.
<br>
On this occassion, the UG physics club presented its own platter of relishing exhibitions and experiments. From levitating superconductors in liquid nitrogen, to hypnotizing patterns made out of falling sand, from seemingly gravity-defying magnets, to bright fringes produced by electron beams. The Ensemble Open Day exhibitions were a huge success among the public, and hopefully left the guests in awe of the wonders physics has to offer.
<br>
A list of the experiments performed are given below, followed by the pictures of our volunteers and convenors in action!</p>
