Wednesday 
6pm 
Praveen J (3rd year UG) will present an introductory talk on basic Quantum computing with the necessary Quantum mechanics. The talk will cover basic Quantum algorithms. No prerequisites, but familiarity with linear algebra will help. Estimated length of talk ~ 1 hr. Notes and references will be shared at the end of the talk.

I'm sharing my [notes](https://indianinstituteofscience.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/ASCENDTalks/EYnBdP1CC-JPpPLjwBznso4BTG4bB-StMP8TcyduSDPhKA?e=pwxYBL) for the above. Also sharing a [review](https://indianinstituteofscience.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/ASCENDTalks/EeMq6Z55-HdLri1K_ZQgrmgB-gtj1crh7gRWXRvde-IjXw?e=P8CKv5)that talks about why QM is linear and might help clarify few of the doubts that came up. If anyone wants any further readings into the topic of QC and related fields, feel free to ask.
