We hope you all had a wonderful summer break and are ready to dive back into physics discussions because Paper Presentation 2.0 is here!
This second round continues the momentum of the first, with new topics and deeper explorations. The aim is simple: engage with key research papers and present them as your own, sparking discussion and insight.
