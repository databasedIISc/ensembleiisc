Here is another interesting talk, this time on experimental condensed matter physics.

**Title:** Physics of 2D materials  

**Abstract:** The isolation of graphene provided inspiration for making 2D layers from 3D materials by the top-down method and paved the way for the emergence of new and exotic two-dimensional systems with varied electronic properties. While each of the individual 2D materials is exceptional in some ways, they also have limitations which can be circumvented by fabricating multilayer heterostructures via Lego-like stacking. In this brief talk, we will explore the different 'flavors' of 2D materials and their properties. I will also be discussing the electrical properties of 2D systems and discuss the realization of multiple electronic phases in 2D materials, especially graphene-based heterostructures. 

**Speaker:** Aditya Jayaraman, PhD student (under Prof. Arindam Ghosh), IISc.

**Date and Time:** 7th March, 2021; 4PM
