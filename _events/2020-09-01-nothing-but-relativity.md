The titular paper by Palash B Pal is a wonderful generalisation that attempts to find the spacetime transformations governing physics while making only the basest assumptions. In my take on this paper, I will introduce elementary group theory, and then proceed to follow the proof while correcting a minor error in the paper. The talk is highly accessible to second years, who are encouraged to attend.
