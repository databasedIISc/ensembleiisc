On 9 Nov 2024.
At 9:00 pm.
In F-08A, OPB.

We welcome all second year undergraduate students who like Physics in a tiny little corner of their heart to make the correct choice for their major selection. Just like Samasya ;) we have people from a variety of backgrounds to guide you:
those who considered Math but made the sensible choice and did not suffer as much by taking a Physics major
those who considered Chemistry/Biology/Earth Science/Materials but ended up in Physics
those who were sure of their major and stayed fixed on Physics
those who planned on taking Physics but ended up being more than brilliant in Math
those who took a Physics major but did a sh*t ton of Math

Anyone looking for details of courses being offered in the:
Dept. of Physics
Dept. of Instrumentation and Applied Physics
Centre for High Energy Physics

in the upcoming semester is also invited.
Students who want to dabble in Physics but belong to some other major, or are currently first year undergraduate students are also welcome.
