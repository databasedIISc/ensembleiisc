Talk on Experimental CMP for first and second years

<!--more-->

We are delighted to announce a talk on Experimental CMP by Senin Ahammed AP. The details of the talk are mentioned below.

**Speaker:** Senin Ahammed AP
**Date & Time:** 11 May 2025, 9:00 pm onwards.
**Venue:** G-01, OPB.

**Abstract:**  This talk will be divided into three parts. In the first part, I will introduce the field of experimental condensed matter physics and give a broad overview of the different research areas within it. I will also mention some of the topics currently being explored by IISc professors. This section is meant to give general exposure rather than a detailed introduction. In the second part, I will talk about my own experiences in this field at IISc, including my summer projects, and my bachelor’s and master’s thesis work. Again, the focus will be on giving a broad idea rather than going into technical depth. In the final part, I will discuss various opportunities such as summer internships—both in India and abroad—thesis projects outside IISc, and a brief overview of PhD paths in this field.  While people are often excited about the theoretical side of condensed matter physics, many are also intimidated by the experimental side. Through this talk, I hope to clear some of those misconceptions and make the experimental side of the field feel more friendly and less overwhelming. The talk will be interactive, and you are welcome to ask questions or seek clarifications—especially regarding summer research opportunities and PhD applications in this area. The session is open to all, and I especially encourage first- and second-year students to attend.
 
Looking forward to see you all there!
