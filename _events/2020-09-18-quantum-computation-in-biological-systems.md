Title: Quantum Computation in Biological Systems
 
Speaker: Pragati Gupta (5th Year UG)
 
Abstract : 
Quantum computers are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization, substantially faster than classical computers. The quest to physically realize a full-scale quantum computer has proven to be a tough challenge. Surprisingly, some natural systems demonstrate quantum computational effects. One such example is the photosynthetic Fenna-Mathews-Olson(FMO) complex, found in certain light-harvesting bacteria. In this talk, I will discuss how the FMO complex exploits environment assisted quantum transport to transfer light energy with almost 100% efficiency. I will also highlight how this is a promising solution for resolving the problem of noise in quantum computers.
