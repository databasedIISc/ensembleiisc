We will allot you a time slot soon depending on the number of registrations, availability of rooms etc.
 
Tentative Dates: 17th, 18th (and 19th, if necessary) April, 2025
Tentative Venue: G-01, OPB
 
Please note that these sessions are open to everyone - a great chance to explore the diverse research carried out by our seniors and get a glimpse into the many paths that physics can take you on!
 
We encourage all students to attend, ask questions, and learn from the exciting work being presented.
 
Feel free to reach out to us in case of any queries. Looking forward to witnessing your work!
