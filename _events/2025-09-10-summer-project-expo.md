Summer Projects by 4th and 5th years

<!--more-->

We are excited to announce Ensemble Summer Project Expo 2025, an event where our senior undergraduates will share the projects and academic explorations they undertook over the summer. This is a great chance for all of us to hear directly from them about their research experiences, problem-solving approaches, and the diverse directions they explored. 
 
Date: **Wednesday, 10th September**
Venue: **F08A, OPB**

At the end of Jay's talk, he will describe the application and selection procedure of ANU-FRT scholarship programme by the UG Office. This might be of interest to all majors, specially from the Batch of 2023.
