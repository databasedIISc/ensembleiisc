Announcement of Paper Presentations

<!--more-->
The wait is finally over! The much-anticipated Paper Presentation Event is here, and we’re excited to unveil the topics you’ll be exploring. As promised, the papers selected for our first Paper Presentation Event are not overly tough. Since this is the first edition, we’ve carefully chosen papers that are accessible yet thought-provoking. Additionally, we’ve ensured a diverse range of topics, covering Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Mechanics, High Energy Physics, Astrophysics, and even interdisciplinary papers in Biophysics, Computing, and Mathematics.
 
## Topics and Papers:
 
You can find all the topics and their respective papers at the following OneDrive link: [Ensemble_Paper_Presentations](https://indianinstituteofscience-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/simarnarula_iisc_ac_in/EjjO3_8hUqFCoCVhsKs0zjYBK6nsFzqoW_Tgtf2pK5uRlw?e=U7wbbP) .
It is highly recommended that you review each topic folder to understand the content thoroughly. Below is a list of all the topics along with a very concise description of the papers included:
Attosecond Physics – Comprehensive review paper on ultrafast electron dynamics.
Berry’s Phase & Aharonov-Bohm Effect – Original seminal papers by Berry and Aharonov-Bohm.
Biophysics – Seminal study on microorganism locomotion at low Reynolds numbers.
Bloch & Kroing Penny – Original seminal papers on quantum behavior in solids.
Chandrasekhar Limit – Original work paired with a simplified approach to stellar limits.
Cosmic Microwave Background – Discovery account paired with a review on anisotropies.
Cosmic Rays – Pioneering discovery and identification with a classic radiation study.
Dark Matter – Review paper by Cirelli et al.; present the first two chapters.
EPR & Bell’s Theorem – Foundational papers on quantum entanglement and reality.
Betelgeuse dimming  – Astronomical studies on the great dimming of Betelgeuse in 2019-20 with discussions on stellar surface mass ejections and tomography.
Grover’s Algorithm – Original paper alongside quantum search via adiabatic evolution.
Isoperimetric Inequality – Mathematical foundations and CERN applications of the inequality.
LIGO & Gravitational Waves – Discovery report and a review of gravitational wave detectors.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance – Original contributions by Purcell and Bloch.
Penning Trap – Nobel lectures and pioneering radiofrequency spectroscopy studies.
Quantum Zeno Effect – Original theory complemented by its first experimental observation.
Stimulated Emission & Lasers – Original papers on the topic by Einstein and Schalow.
Theory of Electronic Semiconductors – Wilson’s original work on band theory and transport.
 
## Instructions & Guidelines
In the OneDrive link, each topic has its own folder. Within each folder, you will find two subfolders: Main Paper and References.
Main Paper: Contains all the papers that you are required to present. It is imperative that you cover every paper in the Main Paper folder.
References: Contains additional materials for your reference; these are not required to be present but are highly recommended to be read for a better understanding of the topic.
If the Main Paper folder contains a READ_ME document, please adhere to its instructions regarding the sections to be presented.
Form teams of up to 3 members. Although solo presentations are allowed, teamwork is highly recommended.
Present the papers as if they were your own research. If the material is extensive, focus on the key ideas, but ensure that all papers in the Main Paper folder are covered.
Review all topics carefully and choose wisely.
One member from each team must email me (simarnarula@iisc.ac.in) by Monday evening with your top three topic preferences and the names of your teammates.
Prepare a presentation of approximately 25 minutes, followed by a Q&A session.
The final event date is yet to be decided, but it is likely to be held on either the March 29–31 weekend or the April 5–6 weekend.
 
We look forward to an engaging and insightful presentation event. Good luck, and let the preparations begin!
