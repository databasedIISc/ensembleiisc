Major Selection Talk for Physics majors

<!--more-->

After hearing from all other majors, it's time to hear about the major that you'll take anyways!

You, Sophomores, are at a crossroads today. You're being told to be practical, to be realistic, to choose an easy path. But we don't do Physics because it's easy. We study physics because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. Chemistry, Biology, Maths, Materials; these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But physics, beauty, curiosity, wonder... these are what we stay alive for.

So meet with us, the upper-year ghosts of the Dead Physicists' Society, on 15th Nov from **9:30pm** at **F-08A**, where we will:
Stand on our desks (metaphorically... probably) to show you how to look at physics in a new light.
Discuss the courses: The "Carpe Diems" (the ones to seize!) and the "Caveat Emptors" (the ones to... approach with caution).
Share our 'why': Why we chose this path and why, despite the all-nighters, we’d do it all again (I guess).
Answer your questions: No holds barred. Ask us about research, courses, life, lab reports, or which energy drink to pick for solving those integrals!

So let's gather for the Physics Major Selection Meeting. No we don't have pizzas to offer you. We just have our enthusiasm. With this enthusiasm, we would write you a weird announcement with a movie reference when we have a quiz to prepare for the next day. But you are not nerdy enough to understand that!
