We had a big year. We did lots of new stuff and tried a lot of things collectively. And Nikshay Chugh, Abhishek Kundu and I are extremely happy to be moving on from this huge 'convenership' thing.
 
First off, we'd like to pass the baton (and that huge Ensemble flex print poster) to Ritabrata Ghosh, Simar Narula and Gunda Sai Vinay for 2025! We had some really good applications and getting three was difficult, but life's difficult anyway. To all other applicants we merely ask that they contribute as much as possible to the club's activities and growth. Ensemble isn't some authoritarian thing anyway, it's a very organic club.
And next. And this took a long, long time to finish. But it's finally here. We give to you, 'The Canonical', the first Inter IISER-IISc Physics magazine. We have articles from the following physics clubs across India:

Ensemble, IISc (of course)
Phi@I, IISER Mohali
137 Inverse, IISER Behrampur
IBPC, IISER Bhopal
Gluon, IISER Kolkata

It's been a great team effort. Special thanks to Panchariya Chinmay Anil, Patricia Kshetri, Ritabrata Ghosh, Ritabrata Saha, Gunda Sai Vinay, Jahin Sadat Mollah, Amrita Sadhuram Notani and Sachin Ghongde for putting in effort, be it in content writing, interviewing professors, or the all important designing portions. Love y'all. I hope we continue this trend and get to see bigger, better collaborations with our fellow IISERs. Find a PDF of the Canonical attached herewith. We really hope you like it. Share it with people you know so that our lil club's visibility increases 
 
That's pretty much it. Thank you for all the love and support and for showing up forcibly to events when we called.
 
Signing off,
Sheersh, Nikshay and Abhishek
